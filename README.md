### Features Implemented

-   **Semantic HTML:** The project is structured with semantic tags like `<article>`, `<figure>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>` for improved accessibility and SEO.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout seamlessly adapts from a single-column view on mobile to a two-column view on tablets and desktops using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
-   **Dynamic Content:** The current UTC time is displayed in milliseconds and updates in real-time every second using JavaScript's `Date.now()`.
-   **Test-Ready:** All required elements include specific `data-testid` attributes to allow for automated testing.
-   **Accessible:** All interactive elements (links) are keyboard-navigable with clear and visible focus styles.
-   **Custom Web Font:** Uses the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern aesthetic.
-   **Interactive UI:** Features modern, icon-based social media buttons with subtle hover and focus animations.

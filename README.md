-   **Multi-Page Navigation:** Clean and consistent navigation between the Home, About, and Contact pages.

-   **Detailed 'About Me' Page:** A structured, single-column page for personal reflections, goals, and thoughts, built with semantic HTML.
-   **Contact Form with Client-Side Validation:** A fully functional contact form that validates all fields (required, email format, message length) using vanilla JavaScript. Visual feedback is provided for errors, and a success message is shown upon valid submission.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** The entire application, including all three pages, is optimized for a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
-   **Dynamic Content (UTC Time):** The homepage displays the current UTC time in milliseconds, updated in real-time.
-   **Test-Ready (`data-testid`s):** All required elements across all pages include specific `data-testid` attributes as per the task requirements, making the application ready for automated testing.
-   **Accessibility:** The project adheres to accessibility best practices, including semantic HTML, ARIA attributes for form validation, and full keyboard navigability.

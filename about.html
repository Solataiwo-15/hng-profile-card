                While I am confident in my core frontend skills, an area I am actively working to improve is advanced state management in large-scale applications. I am also focusing on deepening my knowledge of backend integrations and DevOps practices to become a more well-rounded developer.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that the best products are built at the intersection of design and engineering. My background in UI/UX principles allows me to bridge that gap, ensuring that the applications I build are not only functional but also delightful to use.
